MCM 2025 Problem B: Managing Sustainable Tourism in Juneau, Alaska
================================================================

PROBLEM OVERVIEW:
- Location: Juneau, Alaska (accessible only by air/sea, no roads)
- Key Challenge: Balance tourism revenue, glacier preservation, resident quality of life
- Time Horizon: 2025-2045 (20 years)
- Current State: 1.6M tourists/year, $375M revenue, 32K population

KEY DATA POINTS EXTRACTED:
=========================

Tourism Metrics:
- 2023 Visitors: 1,600,000
- 2023 Revenue: $375,000,000
- Tourism Season: ~180 days/year (June-October peak)
- Per Capita Spending: ~$234/visitor
- Access: Cruise ships (80%+) + flights

Population & Demographics:
- Permanent Residents: 32,000
- Economic Dependence: High reliance on tourism
- Quality of Life Concerns: Traffic, housing, services strain

Environmental Concerns:
- Mendenhall Glacier: Major attraction, significant retreat observed
- Natural Retreat Rate: ~5% annually
- Tourist Impact: Additional retreat acceleration
- Ecosystem Sensitivity: Fragile subarctic environment

Current Challenges:
- Seasonal Overcrowding: Cruise ship surges
- Infrastructure Strain: Limited capacity for growth
- Environmental Impact: Glacier retreat acceleration
- Resident Impact: Quality of life degradation
- Economic Pressure: Need for sustainable revenue streams

Proposed Solutions Needed:
- Capacity Management: Daily visitor limits
- Pricing Strategies: Entrance fees, dynamic pricing
- Environmental Investment: Glacier protection funding
- Resident Support: Quality of life improvements
- Long-term Planning: 20-year sustainable strategy

MODEL ASSUMPTIONS USED:
======================

Tourism System:
- Daily Capacity Range: 10,000 - 20,000 visitors
- Entrance Fee Range: $0 - $50
- Environmental Investment: 10-50% of revenue
- Tourist Attraction: Glacier (40%), Whale watching (30%), Crowding effects (30%)
- Crowding Threshold: 15,000 daily visitors

Glacier Dynamics:
- Initial Size: 1.0 (normalized)
- Natural Retreat: 5% annually
- Tourist Acceleration: +20% retreat per million additional visitors
- Investment Mitigation: Environmental spending reduces retreat by 10-50%

Socio-Economic Factors:
- Resident Satisfaction: Max(0, 1 - 0.5 × tourist/resident ratio)
- Revenue Streams: Entrance fees + per capita spending
- Crowding Penalty: Reduced spending when above capacity
- Discount Rate: 5% for NPV calculations

SUCCESS METRICS:
===============

Objectives (Multi-objective Optimization):
1. Economic: Maximize NPV of tourism revenue (2025-2045)
2. Environmental: Maximize final glacier preservation
3. Social: Maximize average resident satisfaction

Key Performance Indicators:
- Total 20-year tourist visits
- Average annual revenue
- Glacier preservation percentage
- Resident satisfaction levels
- Revenue volatility and stability

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
=================

Pareto Optimal Solutions:
- Economic Priority: High revenue, lower environmental/social performance
- Environmental Priority: Maximum glacier preservation, moderate revenue
- Social Priority: High resident satisfaction, balanced trade-offs
- Balanced Solutions: Compromise across all objectives

Policy Recommendations:
- Specific daily caps, fees, and investment ratios
- Implementation timeline and monitoring strategies
- Adaptation for other tourism destinations
- Sensitivity analysis and robustness testing

DELIVERABLES:
============

1. Complete Python Implementation
2. Pareto Optimal Solution Set (CSV)
3. Visualization Suite (8+ plots)
4. Policy Recommendation Framework
5. MCM Paper Sections (Model, Results, Discussion)
